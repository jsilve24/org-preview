#+title: Fast, async, upgraded LaTeX previews for Org-mode

Load, run =M-x org-preview-mode=. Use Org as usual. Be amazed.

** Lots to do! [1/14]
+ [X] Consistent equation numbering in the previews
+ [ ] Basic color matching (Match default foreground/background of the theme)
+ [ ] Async support for =dvisvgm=.  (Only supports =dvipng= right now.)
+ [ ] Code organization, refactor into task-specific functions?
+ [ ] Add back image caching.  (Disabled by design right now.)
+ [ ] Async method (process sentinels vs =org-async= vs custom macro)
+ [ ] Equation ↔ Image mismatch handling
+ [ ] Overlay placement mismatch handling (async problem)
+ [ ] Scale matching
+ [ ] Advanced color matching (Match colors at point)
+ [ ] Formula ↔ Text baseline alignment (for png, svg)
+ [ ] Automatic preview toggle on cursor movement
+ [ ] Split preview code from =org.el= (Modularize Org)
+ [ ] Fix Org's code verbosity with macros from Emacs 26+ (=when-let=, =pcase-let=, etc)
